# Aurial

Aurial is a browser-based HTML/JavaScript client interface for streaming music
from a [Subsonic](http://subsonic.org/) service (Subsonic version 5.2 or later
is currently required).

Born from my personal need for a music browser/player which met my needs, 
Aurial's aim is to provide a simple, intuitive and straight-forward interface
to browse and play Subsonic-hosted music, and to be as easy to deploy as it is 
to configure and use.


## Screenshots

Note that the current look and functionality may differ from what is shown 
here, as the application is still under development.
