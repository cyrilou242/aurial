# Aurial

Aurial is a browser-based HTML/JavaScript client interface for streaming music
from a [Subsonic](http://subsonic.org/) service (Subsonic version 5.2 or later
is currently required).

Born from my personal need for a music browser/player which net my needs, 
Aurial's aim is to provide a simple, intuitive and straight-forward interface
to browse and play Subsonic-hosted music, and to be as easy to deploy as it is 
to configure and use.

look and functionality may differ from what is shown here, as the application
is still under rapid development.
